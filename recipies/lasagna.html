    <h2>Lasagna Dish</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a rich and hearty dish made by layering thin sheets with a flavorful filling and a savory sauce. Each
        layer is carefully assembled to create a balanced combination of textures, with a creamy and slightly tangy
        element complementing the heartiness of the dish. Once assembled, it is baked until golden and bubbling,
        allowing the flavors to meld together beautifully.</p>
    <p>The key to a perfect lasagna is patience, as it requires careful layering and the right amount of time in the
        oven to achieve a tender yet structured result. Letting it rest after baking helps it set, making it easier to
        slice and serve. Whether enjoyed fresh out of the oven or as leftovers, lasagna often tastes even better the
        next day as the flavors continue to develop.</p>
