    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Alfredo is a creamy and comforting dish that combines tender pieces of chicken with a rich, velvety
        Alfredo sauce. Served over a bed of pasta, the dish is known for its smooth texture and bold flavors, with a
        hint of garlic and parmesan. The chicken adds a savory protein element, making it a hearty meal perfect for any
        occasion. Whether made at home or enjoyed at a restaurant, Chicken Alfredo is a classic favorite that never
        disappoints.</p>
    <p>The dish is also highly customizable. You can add vegetables like broccoli or mushrooms, or even switch up the
        protein by using shrimp or other types of meat. The rich sauce pairs beautifully with the tender pasta, and the
        possibilities for variation make it an ideal meal for all tastes. Whether you prefer it a little lighter or
        loaded with extra flavor, Chicken Alfredo adapts to suit your needs.</p>
